I have completed the introduction of Blazor App via this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/blazor-tutorial/intro

The process involves: 
1. Dowloaded and Installed the .NET 7 ARM64 (Apple Silicon).
2. Creating and Setting up the Blazor in the terminal --> dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorApp --no-https -f net7.0
3. CD forwards to the Blazer folder
4. Run the app with Dotnet watch
5. Run through the counter code --> C# can be used inside Blazor instead of the JavaScript
6. Write <Counter /> inside the Index.razor --> the counter will then appear inside Home which is the index page. the dotnet watch will save the changes and make the counter button appear on the index page.
7. Custom the increment amount by 10. This process is conducted through the adding of public property with parameter attribute
8. End of Blazor introduction
